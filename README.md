*IMPORTANT NOTES*

There are 2 versions of the website, the more completed, but non-functioning HTML/CSS/JS w/ excel version, and the unfinished Meteor version. If you would like to continue working on the Meteor version, you will have to install meteor at https://www.meteor.com/install ; you can install it on windows, but a virtual machine Ubuntu is preferred. We would recommend switching the project to Django, but you may do as you see fit.
